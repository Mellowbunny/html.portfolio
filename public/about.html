<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Imani Matthews. </p>

<p>I am a rookie web developer. A recent graduate from University of Pittsburgh.I had started this training since November 2023. 
  To be honest I was nervous beginning my journey in coding, 
  but I've learned to enjoy it now.</p>

<p>I hope that when I complete this course from Angela Yu, my instructor,
   I can fluently create websites from scratch.</p>
